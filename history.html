        <h1 id="histitle">History of IEEE in Short</h1>
        <p>IEEE in short is an organization formed by the consolidation of AIEE
            (American Institute of Electrical Engineers) and the IRE (Institute of Radio
            Engineers). From its earliest origins, the IEEE has advanced the theory and
            application of electro technology and allied sciences, served as a catalyst
            for technological innovation and supported the needs of its members through a
            wide variety of programs and services.</p>

        <p>Institute of Electrical and Electronics EngineersThe last quarter of the nineteenth century was marked by a
            tremendous growth in electrical technology. By the early 1880s, telegraph wires crisscrossed the United
            States.
            Europe and America were connected by underwater cable while arc lights were in use in several cities.</p>

        <p>From the beginning, the major interests of the AIEE Institute were wire communications and light and power
            systems. An early and active participant in the development of electrical industry standards, the Institute
            laid
            the foundations for all work on electrical standards done in the United States. During its first three
            decades,
            the AIEE confronted and resolved such internal concerns as locating permanent headquarters for the
            organization
            providing mechanisms for contact with a far-flung membership and with students, and fostering new technical
            interests through committees that were established to meet the challenge of increasing specialization.</p>

        <p>By 1912, however, the interests and needs of those specializing in the expanding field of radio could no
            longer
            be satisfied by periodic technical committee meetings in their local areas.
            Two largely local organizations – the Society of Wireless and Telegraph Engineers and the Wireless Institute
            –
            merged to form an international society for scientists and engineers involved in the development of wireless
            communications - the Institute of Radio Engineers. Many of the original members of the IRE were members of
            the
            AIEE and both organizations continued to have members in common until they merged to form the IEEE in 1963.
            The
            structural development and general activities of the IRE were similar to those of the AIEE.</p>

        <p>Specialized segments were gathered into professional groups under a central governing body. Geographical
            units
            and student branches were formed. Meetings and publications facilitated the creation of an extensive
            literature
            and the exchange of knowledge. Membership grades were established. Standards development became a major
            effort.</p>

        <p>The nature of radio technology meant that the interests of the IRE went beyond national boundaries.
            Therefore,
            the new organization sought and attracted members from many countries and eventually established units in
            several areas throughout the world. From the beginning the 'Proceedings of the IRE' regularly published
            papers
            from authors outside the United States.</p>

        <p>In the 1930's, electronics became part of the vocabulary of electrical
            engineering. Electronics engineers tended to become members of the IRE, but the applications of electron
            tube
            technology became so extensive that the technical boundaries differentiating the IRE and the AIEE became
            difficult to distinguish.</p>

        <p>After World War II, the two organizations became increasingly competitive. Problems of overlap and
            duplication
            of efforts arose, only partially resolved by joint committees and meetings.</p>

        <p>In 1961, the leadership of both the IRE and the AIEE resolved to seek an end to these difficulties through
            consolidation. The next year a merger plan was formulated and approved and became effective on January 1,
            1963.</p>
